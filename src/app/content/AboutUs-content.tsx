export const aboutMeInfo = ["Hi! I’m Erica, a certified birth and postpartum doula, lactation counselor, and mama of four residing in Treasure Valley, Idaho. I have a passion for all things birth, breastfeeding, and babies! Shortly after the birth of my third child in 2020, I felt a strong calling to birthwork and began the certification process. Over the last few years I have found incredible fulfillment in helping my fellow mamas on their pregnancy, birth, and postpartum journeys.", "I believe in the strength and power of women and mothers, and consider it a great honor to provide support during one of the most challenging yet potentially transformative phases of life. My goal as a doula and lactation counselor is to offer caring, informed, and empowering support for families of all backgrounds, perspectives, and preferences. I strongly believe in every woman‘s right and ability to make wise, informed choices and to be cared for, respected, and honored at every stage of pregnancy, birth, and beyond. My goal as your birth doula is to support you in having the best birth experience possible, whether it be in the hospital, birth center, or home. As a postpartum doula, I provide further support to you and your family during the vital healing and transitional period after birth. As a lactation counselor, I can walk you through the challenges of breastfeeding and/or bottle feeding.", "My qualifications include birth and postpartum doula certification through Childbirth International, lactation counselor certification (CLC) through ALPP, VBAC doula certification with VBAC Link, and training in HypnoBabies. I also hold a Bachelor’s in Marriage, Family, and Human Development from BYU-Provo. I am continually learning new things and working on further certifications in prenatal nutrition, bereavement support, and childbirth education.", "I believe that birth and postpartum support should be individualized to the needs of the entire family and that no two clients are alike. I work to provide evidence-based information and emotional/physical support, and to serve alongside your partner as a guardian of your needs and desires. I believe that, ultimately, YOU are the expert on your baby and your body, and my job is to help foster a birth and postpartum experience that honors your innate wisdom.", "When I’m not busy with birthwork, I enjoy reading, writing, playing the piano, theater, and running. As a homeschool mama, I love reading aloud to my kids from the classics and going on wonderful adventures! I love teaching music and also run a music studio with my husband.", "As a mother with a range of birth experiences and motherhood challenges, I understand how important it is to have someone to “walk with you” on your journey. Please reach out if you feel I might be a good fit! I currently take 1-2 birth clients a month. I’m available for scheduled postpartum shifts and breastfeeding support as well. I’d love to chat with you!"]
