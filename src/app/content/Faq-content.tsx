      answer: {
        paragraphs: [`Anyone on your care team (family member or friend, nurse, midwife, etc) can…and often do!...provide labor support. There is a proven benefit to the presence of a labor companion.`, `However, doulas are unique in that their entire focus is on continuous labor support - they do not have any other clinical tasks, responsibilities, or anxieties distracting them from this role. A doula’s primary responsibility during labor is to the client - not to a hospital administrator, not to a charge nurse, not to a partner or other family members, not to a midwife or doctor.`, `There will be times when your partner will need to take a break to eat or use the bathroom, and they may need support during their own emotional journey during this time. Friends and family members may have limited knowledge about the birth process, labor positions, medical procedures, or what goes on in a hospital. A doula is well-versed in these areas and trained to inform and support the client as well as their partner. Midwives, L&D nurses, and the occasional OB may provide support, but their primary focus is on clinical tasks that ensure the medical well-being of you and your baby.`, `Ideally, doulas and partners work together as a labor support team. In one study*, researchers found that combining a supportive partner and a doula significantly lowered the risk of a Cesarean compared to having a supportive partner alone. The results showed a 25% Cesarean rate among first-time mothers with a partner only compared to 13.3% among those with a partner and a doula. Among those whose labor was induced, the result was even greater: Cesarean rate of 58.8% among those without a doula vs. 12.5% in the group with a doula. Also, those with a doula had lower rates of epidural use.`, `In other studies*, fathers have reported that, with a doula, they had things explained to them, their questions answered, their support to their partner was guided and effective, and that they could take breaks from the emotional intensity of labor without abandoning their partner. Doulas provide education to partners not only on the mechanics of birth, but also on how to advocate for the mother during the birth experience.`, `*For references, please visit https://evidencebasedbirth.com/the-evidence-for-doulas/`], // If using more than one paragraph, separate each paragraph into its own string element

These are times when a doula can relieve the partner for a brief period and fully take over, ensuring that you are not left unsupported for a moment. If you have other children, your partner may be distracted trying to care for them as well, and a doula’s presence ensures that you always have someone 100% focused on you.`,`A doula can also support your partner by providing reassurance, answering questions, and providing information on the labor process and what to expect.

It is normal and expected for a baby (especially a breastfed one) to wake every 1.5-3 hours at night, simply because their caloric needs are so high in the first few months. Babies are rapidly growing at this point and are dependent on a supply/demand system to receive adequate nutrition, leading to what may seem a sporadic sleep and eating schedule. `, `Recognizing the developmental need for newborns to wake frequently during the night, I do not provide any education on sleep training specifically. However, I can discuss with you good sleep hygiene habits that can assist both you and your baby in getting the rest that you need. These techniques will help your baby to become accustomed to calming rhythms that will benefit the entire family, including tips on creating a consistent and peaceful night time environment, nurturing positive sleep associations, implementing effective soothing techniques, etc.`], // If using more than one paragraph, separate each paragraph into its own string element
